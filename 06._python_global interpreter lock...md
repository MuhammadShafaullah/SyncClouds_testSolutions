### 06. python is known to have a global interpreter lock, can you still run python code in parallel across multiple physical cores ?elaborate on the answer

> Yes, it is possible to run Python code in parallel across multiple physical cores,
despite the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that is present in CPython, the most widely
used implementation of Python. The GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python 
bytecode simultaneously, but it does not prevent multiple processes from running simultaneously.
There are several ways to run Python code in parallel across multiple cores:

**multiprocessing module:** The multiprocessing module in Python provides a way to create 
separate processes, each with its own interpreter and memory space. This allows 
multiple processes to run in parallel, bypassing the GIL.

**concurrent.futures module:** The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level 
interface for asynchronously executing callables. It has an Executor class that 
uses a pool of worker threads to run callables asynchronously.

**Asynchronous programming:** Asynchronous programming allows you to write non-blocking 
code by using async/await keywords. This allows to run multiple tasks in parallel, 
it can be used with any library that support async/await.

**Multithreading libraries:** libraries such as threading, thread, and queue are used to
run multiple threads in parallel. However, these libraries only work with I/O bound 
tasks, not CPU bound tasks

**Numba :** is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Python that can automatically parallelize 
loops and functions. It is particularly useful for numerical and scientific computing.

> It's important to keep in mind that parallel programming can be complex and error-prone,
it's recommended to use libraries that abstract the complexity of parallel programming, 
such as concurrent.futures and multiprocessing to achieve parallelism.
