how to ensure they get restarted when that happens ?

There are several ways to ensure that a service gets restarted when it goes down in production:

Use a process manager: A process manager, such as Supervisor or systemd,
can be used to automatically restart a service if it crashes or exits unexpectedly.
These tools can be configured to monitor the service and automatically start it again
if it stops running.

Use a monitoring tool: A monitoring tool, such as Nagios or Prometheus, 
can be used to monitor the health of a service and send notifications if it goes down.
This can be configured to automatically restart the service if it goes down.

Use a container orchestration tool: Container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes
and Docker Swarm, can be used to manage and automatically restart containers running 
your service. These tools can be configured to automatically restart a container if it
crashes or exits unexpectedly.

Use a cloud service: Many cloud providers offer services that can automatically restart 
failed instances. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk, Google App
Engine, and Azure App Service all have built-in support for automatically restarting 
failed instances.
