### 05. we have 100 separate python scripts connecting at the same time to a central postgres 
database to perform multiple operations like reads and writes postgres creates a 
separate process for each ofthese clients, which is not efficient and consumes too much resources.
how to make the central postgres db handle these concurrent connexions more efficiently ?

There are several ways to make a central PostgreSQL database handle concurrent connections more efficiently:

Connection pooling: Use a connection pooling library, such as psycopg2's pool module or
SQLAlchemy's connection pool, to reuse connections and reduce the number of connections
that need to be created and destroyed.

Increase max_connections: Increase the max_connections parameter in the postgresql.
conf file to allow more connections to be made to the database. This can be done by 
adding max_connections = x to the configuration file, where x is the maximum number of
connections you want to allow.

Use a load balancer: Use a load balancer, such as HAProxy or Nginx, to distribute 
connections across multiple databases. This can help to reduce the number of connections
to a single database and improve performance.

Monitor and tune the database: Use tools such as pgAdmin or pg_stat_activity to monitor 
the performance of the database and tune parameters such as shared_buffers, 
effective_cache_size, and work_mem to optimize performance.

Asynchronous execution: Use an asynchronous execution library such as asyncpg to 
handle the queries in an asynchronous way, this will prevent the script from blocking 
the execution while waiting for the query to finish.

Use read replicas: Use read replicas to handle read-only queries, 
this will reduce the load on the primary database and increase the performance.

It's also important to make sure that the scripts are optimized,
avoiding unnecessary queries and using indexes when required. 
Additionally, it's recommended to use the latest version of postgres, 
as it might have performance improvements over the previous versions.
