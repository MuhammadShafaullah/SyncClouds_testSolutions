### 07. our sysadmin team deploy our project from github onto two servers, usually this operation results in a 1 hour downtime. our estimates say we will need about 20 servers to handle the load during next months. we cannot afford to have 20 * 1 hours downtime to make new deployments, how can we efficiently deploy our projects onto these 20 servers with minimam downtime ?


> There are several strategies that can be used to deploy a project onto multiple servers with minimal downtime:

**Blue-Green Deployment:** This strategy involves having two identical environments, 
one labeled "blue" and the other "green". The "blue" environment is the production 
environment and the "green" environment is used for testing and deployment. 
When a new deployment is ready, it is deployed to the "green" environment and tested.
Once it is deemed stable, the traffic is switched to the "green" environment, 
making it the new "blue" environment. This allows for a seamless transition 
with minimal downtime.

**Rolling Deployment:** This strategy involves deploying the new version of the project to 
a small number of servers at a time, and then rolling it out to the rest of the servers.
This allows for a gradual rollout, with minimal impact on the users.

**Canary Deployment:** This strategy is similar to Rolling Deployment but instead of 
deploying the update to a small number of servers, it's deployed to a small percentage 
of the user base. After monitoring the performance of the update, it is then deployed 
to the rest of the servers.

**Containerization:** Using containerization technologies such as Docker, you can package 
your application and all its dependencies into a single container. This allows you to 
deploy the container to any server, regardless of the underlying operating system.

**Automation:** Automating the deployment process can help to reduce the time it takes 
to deploy the project and minimize the chances of human error. Using tools like Ansible,
Puppet, or Chef to automate the deployment process can greatly reduce downtime.

**Push-button deployment:** using tools like Jenkins, Circle CI, or GitLab CI/CD, 
you can create a pipeline that deploys your code automatically after a push to a 
specific branch. This allows you to deploy your code with minimal downtime and human 
intervention.

>It's important to note that depending on your project, 
one strategy may be more appropriate than the others, 
it's recommended to test and choose the strategy that works best for your project.
