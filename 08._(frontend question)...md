### 8) (frontend question) In a large project with dozens of components, what would you do to ensure scalability?What things do you keep in mind while building a component? Finally, Use a third-party or go on with your own solution? How would you decide?

> To ensure scalability in a large project with dozens of components, I would consider the following:

**Modularity:** Break the project down into smaller, more manageable components that canbe 
developed, tested, and deployed independently.

**Loose Coupling:** Ensure that each component is loosely coupled with the others, 
so that changes to one component do not affect the others.

**Performance Optimization:** Optimize the performance of each component and the system as
a whole by using caching, load balancing, and other techniques.

**Monitoring and logging:** Monitor and log the performance of each component and the 
system as a whole, so that any issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

**Automation:** Automate the deployment and scaling of the system, so that it can handle 
increased load without manual intervention.

> When building a component, I would keep in mind:

The component's role and purpose within the system
The component's expected load and usage patterns
The component's scalability requirements
The component's security requirements
The component's maintainability

As for the decision of using a third-party or going on with your own solution, 
it would depend on the specific needs of the component and the project as a whole.

If the component's requirements can be met by a widely-used, 
well-maintained third-party solution, it may be more cost-effective and efficient 
to use that solution.

If the component requires specialized functionality that is not available in any 
existing third-party solutions, it may be necessary to build a custom solution.

If the component requires tight integration with other components within the system, 
it may be more cost-effective and efficient to build a custom solution.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on a trade-off between the cost, time, and 
effort of building a custom solution and the benefits of using a third-party solution
