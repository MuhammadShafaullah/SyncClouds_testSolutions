### 2) When you run a database query, how do you make the database send result data to the client directly without loading all the result set onto onto its memory before sending it to client ? ( client here being a script, not the browser)

When running a database query, one way to make the database send result data to the 
client directly without loading all the result set onto its memory before sending it 
is by using a cursor. A cursor is a database object that allows you to traverse through 
the result set one row at a time, rather than loading the entire result set into memory at once.

In the case of a relational database management system (RDBMS) like PostgreSQL or MySQL,
the client can use a server-side cursor, where the cursor is created and managed on 
the server, and the client can retrieve rows one at a time.

Another way is to limit the number of rows retrieved by a query using the LIMIT keyword.
This way, the database will only retrieve the specified number of rows and send them to 
the client, rather than retrieving all the rows in the result set.

Additionally, you can make use of pagination, which is a technique that allows you to 
retrieve a specific "page" of data from a larger dataset. This is usually done by 
specifying the starting point and the number of records to retrieve.

In the case of a NoSQL databases like MongoDB, it uses a cursor-like object called 
the find() method, which returns a cursor object that can be iterated over to retrieve 
documents one at a time, rather than loading the entire result set into memory at once.

> It's worth noting that the way to use cursor depends on the programming language and 
the driver you're using to interact with the database.
